#
# Problem definition
# ******************
#
# This problem is to minimise the compliance
#
# .. math::
#       \int_{\Omega} fT + \alpha \int_{\Omega} \nabla a \cdot \nabla a
#
# subject to the Poisson equation with mixed Dirichlet--Neumann
# conditions
#
# .. math::
#       -\mathrm{div}(k(a) \nabla T) &= f  \qquad \mathrm{in} \ \Omega           \\
#                         T &= 0  \qquad \mathrm{on} \ \delta \Omega_D  \\
#           (k(a) \nabla T) &= 0  \qquad \mathrm{on} \ \delta \Omega_N  \\
#
# and to the control constraints
#
# .. math::
#          0 \le a(x) &\le 1  \qquad \forall x \in \Omega \\
#          \int_{\Omega} a &\le V
#
# where :math:`\Omega` is the unit square, :math:`T` is the temperature,
# :math:`a` is the control (:math:`a(x) = 1` means material, :math:`a(x)
# = 0` means no material), :math:`f` is a prescribed source term (here
# the constant :math:`10^{-2}`), :math:`k(a)` is the Solid Isotropic
# Material with Penalisation parameterisation :cite:`bendsoe2003`
# :math:`\epsilon + (1 - \epsilon) a^p` with :math:`\epsilon` and
# :math:`p` prescribed constants, :math:`\alpha` is a regularisation
# term, and :math:`V` is the volume bound on the control.
#
# Physically, the problem is to finding the material distribution
# :math:`a(x)` that minimises the integral of the temperature when the amount of highly
# conducting material is limited. This code makes several approximations to
# this physical problem. Instead of solving an integer optimisation problem (at each
# location, we either have conducting material or we do not), a continuous relaxation
# is performed; this is standard in topology optimisation :cite:`bendsoe2003`. Furthermore,
# the discrete solution varies as the mesh is refined: the continuous solution exhibits
# features at all scales, and these must be carefully handled in a discretisation
# of the problem. In this example we merely add a fixed :math:`H^1` regularisation
# term; a better approach is to add a mesh-dependent Helmholtz filter (see for example
# :cite:`lazarov2011`).
#
# This example demonstrates how to implement general control
# constraints, and how to use IPOPT :cite:`wachter2006` to solve the
# optimisation problem.
#
# Implementation
# **************
#
# First, the :py:mod:`dolfin` and :py:mod:`dolfin_adjoint` modules are
# imported:

from fenics import *

from fenics_adjoint import *

# Next we import the Python interface to IPOPT. If IPOPT is
# unavailable on your system, we strongly :doc:`suggest you install it
# <../../download/index>`; IPOPT is a well-established open-source
# optimisation algorithm.


try:
    from pyadjoint import ipopt  # noqa: F401
except ImportError:
    print("""This example depends on IPOPT and Python ipopt bindings. \
  When compiling IPOPT, make sure to link against HSL, as it \
  is a necessity for practical problems.""")
    raise

# turn off redundant output in parallel
parameters["std_out_all_processes"] = False

# Next we define some constants, and the Solid Isotropic Material with
# Penalisation (SIMP) rule.

V = Constant(0.4)  # volume bound on the control
p = Constant(5)  # power used in the solid isotropic material
# with penalisation (SIMP) rule, to encourage the control
# solution to attain either 0 or 1
eps = Constant(1.0e-3)  # epsilon used in the solid isotropic material
alpha = Constant(1.0e-8)  # regularisation coefficient in functional


def k(a):
    """Solid isotropic material with penalisation (SIMP) conductivity
  rule, equation (11)."""
    return eps + (1 - eps) * a ** p


# Next we define the mesh (a unit square) and the function spaces to be
# used for the control :math:`a` and forward solution :math:`T`.

n = 250
mesh = UnitSquareMesh(n, n)
A = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)  # function space for control
P = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)  # function space for solution


# Next we define the forward boundary condition and source term.

class WestNorth(SubDomain):
    """The top and left boundary of the unitsquare, used to enforce the Dirichlet boundary condition."""

    def inside(self, x, on_boundary):
        return (x[0] == 0.0 or x[1] == 1.0) and on_boundary


# the Dirichlet BC; the Neumann BC will be implemented implicitly by
# dropping the surface integral after integration by parts
bc = [DirichletBC(P, 0.0, WestNorth())]
f = interpolate(Constant(1.0e-2), P)  # the volume source term for the PDE


# Next we define a function that given a control :math:`a` solves the
# forward PDE for the temperature :math:`T`. (The advantage of
# formulating it in this manner is that it makes it easy to conduct
# :doc:`Taylor remainder convergence tests
# <../../documentation/verification>`.)


def forward(a):
    """Solve the forward problem for a given material distribution a(x)."""
    T = Function(P, name="Temperature")
    v = TestFunction(P)

    F = inner(grad(v), k(a) * grad(T)) * dx - f * v * dx
    solve(F == 0, T, bc, solver_parameters={"newton_solver": {"absolute_tolerance": 1.0e-7,
                                                              "maximum_iterations": 20}})

    return T


# Now we define the ``__main__`` section. We define the initial guess
# for the control and use it to solve the forward PDE. In order to
# ensure feasibility of the initial control guess, we interpolate the
# volume bound; this ensures that the integral constraint and the
# bound constraint are satisfied.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = interpolate(V, A)  # initial guess.
    T = forward(a)  # solve the forward problem once.

# With the forward problem solved once, :py:mod:`dolfin_adjoint` has
# built a *tape* of the forward model; it will use this tape to drive
# the optimisation, by repeatedly solving the forward model and the
# adjoint model for varying control inputs.

# A common task when solving optimisation problems is to implement a
# callback that gets executed at every functional evaluation. (For
# example, this might be to record the value of the functional so that
# it can be plotted as a function of iteration, or to record statistics
# about the controls suggested by the optimisation algorithm.) The
# following callback outputs each evaluation to VTK format, for
# visualisation in paraview. Note that the callback will output each
# *evaluation*; this means that it will be called more often than the
# number of iterations the optimisation algorithm reports, due to line
# searches. It is also possible to implement :doc:`callbacks that are
# executed on every functional derivative calculation
# <../../documentation/optimisation>`.

    controls = File("output/control_iterations.pvd")
    a_viz = Function(A, name="ControlVisualisation")


    def eval_cb(j, a):
        a_viz.assign(a)
        controls << a_viz

# Now we define the functional, compliance with a weak regularisation
# term on the gradient of the material

    J = assemble(f * T * dx + alpha * inner(grad(a), grad(a)) * dx)
    m = Control(a)
    Jhat = ReducedFunctional(J, m, eval_cb_post=eval_cb)

# This :py:class:`ReducedFunctional` object solves the forward PDE using
# dolfin-adjoint's tape each time the functional is to be evaluated, and
# derives and solves the adjoint equation each time the functional
# gradient is to be evaluated. The :py:class:`ReducedFunctional` object
# takes in high-level Dolfin objects (i.e. the input to the evaluation
# ``Jhat(a)`` would be a :py:class:`dolfin.Function`).

# Now let us configure the control constraints. The bound constraints
# are easy:

    lb = 0.0
    ub = 1.0

# The volume constraint involves a little bit more work. Following
# :cite:`nocedal2006`, inequality constraints are represented as
# (possibly vector) functions :math:`g` defined such that :math:`g(a)
# \ge 0`. The constraint is implemented by subclassing the
# :py:class:`InequalityConstraint` class. (To implement equality
# constraints, see the documentation for
# :py:class:`EqualityConstraint`.)  In this case, our :math:`g(a) = V -
# \int_{\Omega} a`. In order to implement the constraint, we have to
# implement three methods: one to compute the constraint value, one to
# compute its Jacobian, and one to return the number of components in
# the constraint.

# The derivative of the constraint g(x) is constant (it is the
# diagonal of the lumped mass matrix for the control function space),
# so let's assemble it here once.  This is also useful in rapidly
# calculating the integral each time without re-assembling.

            self.smass = assemble(TestFunction(A) * Constant(1) * dx)
            self.tmpvec = Function(A)

        def function(self, m):
            from pyadjoint.reduced_functional_numpy import set_local
            set_local(self.tmpvec, m)

# Compute the integral of the control over the domain

            integral = self.smass.inner(self.tmpvec.vector())
            if MPI.rank(MPI.comm_world) == 0:

# Now that all the ingredients are in place, we can perform the
